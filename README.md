# Fast setup for Vim (no install) - Ubuntu
It has customized color themes, snippets and .vimrc file. The goal is to setting up easier and faster a development based Vim version by using a compiled version and all customization that works for me.

# Installation

- apt install vim
- create the folder ~/vim 
- run the install.sh file - ./install.sh

# installed plugins
- pathogen
- nerdtree
- vim-go
- vim-composer
- vim-phpunit
- tlib_vim
- vim-addon-mw-utils
- vim-snipmate
- vim-node
- vim-javascript-syntax
- snipmate-nodejs
- jshint

Have fun!
